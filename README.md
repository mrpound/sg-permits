NYC Dept. of Buildings Permit Scraper for Painted Signs
A weekend web scraping project for a friend who needed a database of all work permits for painted signs issued in NYC between 1989-2013.
The NYC website was horribly unreliable. Getting the script to run to completion without apparently DoSing the site took 3-4x longer than writing the actual scraper code.
